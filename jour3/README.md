# Day 3 - Data Access with Spring Boot

Welcome to Day 3 of the Java Spring development training program at La Plateforme! This day is focused on accessing and managing data using Spring Boot, Java Persistence (JPA), and H2 database.

## My Day 3 Accomplishments

In today's session, I dived into data access with Spring Boot and explored Java Persistence (JPA) along with H2 database integration. Here's an overview of the tasks I completed:

### Job 01 - Understanding JPA

- Researched the Java Persistence API (JPA) and its integration with Spring Data JPA.

**Question: What is JPA, and how does it facilitate database access?**

_Answer: JPA (Java Persistence API) is a Java standard for object-relational mapping (ORM) that simplifies database access and management in Java applications. It provides a convenient way to interact with databases by mapping Java objects to database tables, allowing developers to work with data using object-oriented principles._

### Job 02 - Configuring an H2 Database

- Configured an in-memory H2 database for the application.
- Modified the `application.yml` file to include the necessary properties.

### Job 03 - Creating a JPA Entity

- Created a `Person` class and marked it as a JPA entity.
- Added attributes like `id`, `name`, and `age` to the entity.

<!-- Job 03 Question will be added here -->

### Job 04 - Implementing a JPA Repository

- Created a `PersonRepository` interface that extends `JpaRepository`.
- Experimented with predefined methods provided by Spring Data JPA.

### Job 05 - Using the Repository in a Controller

- Utilized the `PersonRepository` to create and read entities.
- Created a page to display a list of persons.

### Job 06 - Updating and Deleting Data

- Added functionality to update and delete persons from the database via the web page.

## Key Takeaways

- Explored the Java Persistence API (JPA) and its role in simplifying database access in Java applications.
- Configured an in-memory H2 database for development purposes.
- Created a JPA entity to represent persistent data in the application.
- Leveraged Spring Data JPA to interact with the database using repository interfaces.
- Built a web page to display and manipulate data retrieved from the database.

Day 3 has equipped me with valuable skills in data access and management with Spring Boot. I'm excited to continue my journey and explore more advanced topics in Java Spring!
